CS230 Software Design Document

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
 The Gaming Room is a program desisnged to run on a Linux Server so that users all over the world could access and play the game. Users would be able to access it by going to a URL in their web browser and either creating a new profile or logging in using existing credentials. The game involved having two teams try to guess a picture as it is slowly uncovered.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt that I did a good job in the final recommendation of the documentation presenting a good choice of a platform to build the program on. I also felt that my description of the UML diagram was very precise and did a good job of breaking down the structure of the program.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The UML diagram was extremely helpful in the development of the code. It was a very useful resource to look back at to make sure I understood how the program was supposed to work.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose to re-do the section that compares the different operating systems in a table. I found it difficult to come accross good resources that compared different operating platforms against each other from a developer perspective. I would have like to have more time to spend researching as it seems to be a more in depth topic.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I tried to design the program to manage computer resources as well as possible so that more devices could handle the game. This means more users can play, and since the game is multiplayer that seems to be the most important factor in the game.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it with the mentality that I wanted to make it as simple as possible and also manage resources efficiently. Accomplishing both of these things would allow more people to play our game. I looked at how much storage we might need to store the game, and researched which operating platforms to best use for the server.
